# Intro
We would like to make the world a better place, a little bit more polite at least - and we can use
automation to make it happen. This is a form of automation for a GitHub project that will prevent
merging impolite pull requests.
The impolite pull request can be detected as the one that has no “please”, “appreciate”,
“would be great” phrases in the description.

# Objective
This repo contains the code for flask app that will check if a PR created for this repo in polite or not. If not then close the PR.
This flask app is hosted on "http://nikhilguptamyid.pythonanywhere.com"

# Steps to test this automation
### 1. Negative case.
